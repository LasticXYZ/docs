# What are coretime renewals and which cores are eligible for renewal?

Coretime renewals are a feature that allows the continued assignment of Bulk Coretime for a core without going through the regular purchasing process. Renewals can occur at a known price increase, providing predictability and precedence in securing Coretime for established tasks. Cores eligible for renewal must meet certain criteria: they must be previously assigned as a result of a renewal, be migrating from legacy slot leases, or have their Bulk Coretime filled with an unsegmented, fully and finally assigned workload that does not include placement in the Instantaneous Coretime Pool. Renewals are processed during a period before regular purchases, ensuring committed parachains and tasks have a chance to secure their Bulk Coretime.
