# Understanding the Code Structure and Polkadot Ecosystem

## Lastic and Polkadot: Building on the Broker Pallet

Lastic stands as a coretime marketplace operating within the Polkadot ecosystem, originating from the innovative utilization of the broker pallet code. For those beginning their journey with us, a Polkadot wallet is essential. You have the option between Polkadot.js and Talisman to manage your transactions and interact with the ecosystem.

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot represents a groundbreaking multi-chain ecosystem designed to enable diverse blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free fashion; think of it as a network of networks. Central to its architecture are four main networks: **Polkadot, Kusama, Rococo, and Westend**, with the latter two serving as testnets. This structure comprises a single relay chain (the backbone) and multiple parachains (individual blockchains) for specialized operations. Lastic primarily interacts with the Coretime chain, a system chain focusing on optimized and agile block space allocation.

## Getting Started with Rococo Test Money

To experiment and test functionalities without real-world stakes, you can obtain Rococo testnet tokens from the [Polkadot faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/). This is an excellent way to familiarize yourself with transactions and smart contract interactions within a safe environment.

## Basic Interaction and Exploration

For those new to blockchain or seeking to understand the basics of interacting with the Polkadot ecosystem, the [polkadot.js interface](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) is an invaluable resource. Here, you can explore the Coretime chain by navigating to **TEST Rococo & Parachains > Coretime chain**, offering insights into transactions, blocks, and parachain activities.

In additon you can check how things are built under the hood, by checking out [github.com/polkadot-js/apps](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps).
