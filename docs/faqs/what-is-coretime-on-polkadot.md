# What is Coretime on Polkadot?

In the context of Polkadot and its Coretime feature, blockspace takes on a more specialized meaning. Coretime allows for the purchasing of blocks in a span of time, which essentially is the allocation of blockspace for validation and consensus processes on the Polkadot Relay Chain. When a user or project purchases Coretime, they are essentially buying the right to use a portion of the blockspace within a given block or series of blocks on the Polkadot blockchain. This is akin to reserving computational resources and space on the blockchain for a specified amount of time.
