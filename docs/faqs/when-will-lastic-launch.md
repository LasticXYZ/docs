# When will Lastic launch?

Lastic is built on Polkadot's Coretime model, which is currently on the Rococo Testnet and awaiting further development before its launch on Kusama and then Polkadot. We aim to match the launches of Coretime on Kusama and Polkadot with the launch of Lastic's core functionality.

Stay tuned for more updates with a detailed roadmap!
