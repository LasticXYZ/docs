# What is the Coretime Chain?

The Coretime Chain is a proposed new system parachain within the Polkadot Network that is responsible for the sale and management of Coretime. It is designed to handle the allocation of Bulk Coretime and track ownership of Coretime as non-fungible assets (NFTs). The Coretime Chain provides information to the Relay-chain regarding the number of cores available, the tasks running on each core, and accounting information for Instantaneous Coretime Credit. Additionally, it processes renewals and allows for various manipulations of Bulk Coretime, such as transfers, partitioning, interlacing, assignment to tasks, and pooling for Instantaneous Coretime.
