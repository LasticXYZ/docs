# What is Bulk Coretime?

Bulk Coretime is a format of selling Coretime on Polkadot, where it is sold periodically on a specialized system chain called the Coretime Chain. It is allocated in advance of its usage and provides 28 days of a full core to its owner. Owners of Bulk Coretime are tracked on the Coretime Chain, and Bulk Coretime is represented as non-fungible assets (NFTs) that can be traded, partitioned, or used in various ways, such as being allocated to a particular parachain or task, or pooled into the Instantaneous Coretime Pool.
